# Dotfiles

My dotfiles and scripts for different distros. It should be used in conjunction with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the configuration files to the home directory.

## Linking dotfiles
Clone the repository as a subfolder of your home directory (e.g. /home/username/dotfiles). And then execute the following command from inside the directory

```
stow .
```
